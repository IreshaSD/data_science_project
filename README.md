#### ðŸŽ¯ Project Overview
The Student Performance Prediction project is an end-to-end web application designed to predict students' academic performance based on several demographic and educational inputs. Built using Python, Streamlit, and various machine learning techniques, this project provides an easy-to-use interface for educational institutions and researchers to gain insights into student performance.

The core idea is to leverage machine learning models to predict exam scores based on multiple features such as gender, race/ethnicity, parental education, and more. This allows schools and educational experts to identify students who might need additional support, paving the way for personalized academic interventions.
